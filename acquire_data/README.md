# Data Acquisition Module 
- SensorimotorKit's data acquisition functions and modules are neatly organized here
- This is subdivided for different sensory modalities like images, eeg, emg, glove, eyes, etc.
- This module is invoked by the main script `sensorimotorkit/main.py`
- All the functions that are common to all sensory modalities are stored under `sensorimotorkit/data_acquisition/common` module
