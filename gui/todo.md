- need to interface the gui from the main.py 
- folder to save
    - this needs to be a popup 
    - this also needs to propagate through to the program
    - maybe write this in the metadata file in the root of the kit 
    - probably also add duration time to the metadata - this needs to be displayed on variable display 
- add traffic lights for the showing if the process is working - these will be taken from a list of variables
- metadata also needs to have a comments section, participant id, handedness, age, gender all of which need to be displayed on the gui, 
comments can be written in the gui at any time of the experiment - even after stop button is pressed 
- data visualization 
    - camera displays needs to be added
    - glvoe data
